<h1>My Story</h1>
It's no fun being the old lady in the classroom, but you got to do what you go to do!  
I've been whittling away my Information Systems degree for many years.  I finally took a leap of faith and left my full-time job to return to school full-time.  Since I hold an Associate's degree in Information Systems, I've already been working in the field for 13 years.  However, I was having trouble finding a job with a different company without my Bachelor's degree.  I also had moved over to the business side and was on a management track.  I really enjoy the technical side and wanted to move back in that direction.
I took 2 classes over the summer, am enrolled in 6 class this fall, which will leave me with only the Capstone class to take next semester.  
My husband David and I have three kids and two dogs:  Addison - 16, Jack - 14, Tucker - 5, Mo - 8 year old Yorkichon and Maya - 18 month old Golden Retriever.  The last member of our family is Cousin Eddy - a 1983 camper.
